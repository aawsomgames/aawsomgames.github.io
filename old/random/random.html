    <h1>For each of the following, you will identify and explain The Corrupt Bargain, The Spoils System and Pendleton Act. The Nullification Crisis, and The Webster-Hayes Debate.</h1>

    <div class="note">
        <p>The Corrupt Bargain is a political issue that happened in the United States election of 1824. The people involved were John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, and Henry Clay. The election resulted in no clear winner between John Q. Adams and Andrew Jackson. The decision was up to the House of Representatives where the speaker of the house was Henry Clay. Henry hated Andrew Jackson so he used his influence as a speaker to make John Q. Adams win the election.<br>
         <br>
        The Spoils System and Pendleton Act actions that affected that worked for the government of the United States. The Spoils System was implemented by Andrew Jackson to appoint his loyal supporters to government positions after he won the election of 1828. The system was thought to be good at preventing corruption but was the opposite. Most of the reason it was ineffective was because the people appointed were not educated enough to work for the position. To combat the issue they passed the Pendleton Act in 1883 putting an end to unqualified people. The act made people wanting to work in government positions take a test to see if they were qualified and educated to work in government positions.<br>
         <br>
        The Nullification Crisis happened during the 1830s over the protective tariffs they were placing on imported goods. The people involved were Vice President John C. Calhoun, President Andrew Jackson, and the governor of South Carolina. South Carolina opposed the protective tariffs of 1828 and 1832. Their reason was that it favored the North and a tariff would also be placed on the cotton they exported. The crisis was over nullification and if the state could do it. Calhoun supported states' rights and said states had the power to nullify federal laws they deemed unconstitutional. Jackson opposed nullification and emphasized the supremacy of the federal government.<br>
         <br>
        The Webster-Hayne Debate was about nullification. It happened in 1830 and was written by Daniel Webster. The debate was about whether states nullify laws. They argued about whether you could because of states' rights. The debate would create a tension between two sides about that right of the states and federal government power.</p>
